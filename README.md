# محروس (Mahroos) – Absher Tuwaiq Hackathon Projec
## 📌 Overview
**Mahroos** is a national verification service designed to detect and prevent identity spoofing of Saudi government entities.  
The service allows citizens and residents to verify suspicious content such as:

- SMS messages  
- Emails  
- URLs  
- Phone numbers  

By providing a trusted verification point, Mahroos protects users from fraud and helps authorities monitor and stop spoofing attempts before they spread.

## 🎯 Problem & Solution
Fraudsters increasingly use sophisticated techniques to impersonate government communications.  
Mahroos addresses this by:

1. **Early detection of fraudulent patterns** – spotting suspicious links and messages as soon as they appear.  
2. **Identifying targeted entities** – showing which government agencies are most impersonated.  
3. **Mapping vulnerable groups** – highlighting regions and demographics most at risk.  
4. **Building a national spoofing database** – supporting rapid response and analysis.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Official government data** – trusted domains, official links, and contact numbers.  
- **Reported fraud attempts** – suspicious URLs, common phishing keywords, and patterns.  
- **User input** – text messages, links, phone numbers, or screenshots uploaded for verification.  

AI enhances detection by:
- Reading screenshots automatically.  
- Detecting subtle link changes (e.g., `Absher` vs `Absherr`).  
- Continuously learning from new fraud attempts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend Prototype**: Figma (user flows and app design)  
- **Backend Engine**: Google Colab + FastAPI  
- **Connectivity**: ngrok (public endpoints)  
- **Testing**: Postman
